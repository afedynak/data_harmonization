# SQL Query for Data Processing

## NIH Toolbox Data

This SQL query is used to extract and process data from the `baard.opt_nihtb_s1_acute_20250205` table, specifically for two key events: the **Baseline Event** (`OPTBL`) and the **Week 10 Event** (`OPTS1End`). The query retrieves various measurements at both event time points and consolidates them into a single row per `record_id`.

It also handles multiple rows for the same `record_id` and ensures that the most recent, non-duplicated data is retrieved. If there are multiple matching records for a particular event, it uses `GROUP_CONCAT()` to concatenate the values into a single string.

## Purpose

This query retrieves the following data:
- **Baseline Event** (`OPTBL`): Data at the time of the baseline event.
- **Week 10 Event** (`OPTS1End`): Data at the time of the Week 10 event.
  
For each event, the query retrieves the following fields:
- `fcc`
- `dccs`
- `flanker`
- `listSort`
- `pattComp`
- `psm`

## Query Explanation

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Selection of Relevant Data**:
   The `SELECT` statement retrieves data from the table `baard.opt_nihtb_s1_acute_20250205`, focusing on two time events: `OPTBL` (baseline) and `OPTS1End` (Week 10).
   
2. **Case Statements**:
   `CASE` expressions are used to filter and retrieve data corresponding to specific time events. The query handles the `baseline` and `week10` data separately to ensure each eventâ€™s results are in the correct columns.

3. **Handling Duplicates with `GROUP_CONCAT()`**:
   If multiple rows match the criteria for a given `record_id` and event, `GROUP_CONCAT()` concatenates the values for the respective event into a single string. This ensures that you do not lose any data for records with multiple entries.

4. **Column Mapping**:
   Each event (baseline and Week 10) is mapped to its respective columns. The values for the measurements are selected with `MAX()` to ensure only a single value is returned per `record_id` for each event type. If there are duplicates, `GROUP_CONCAT()` ensures that all values are kept.


### Notes:

- **Data Retrieval**: The `WHERE` clause restricts the query to only include rows where `time` is either `OPTBL` (baseline) or `OPTS1End` (Week 10).
- **Handling Duplicates**: `GROUP_CONCAT()` ensures that any duplicate values are concatenated into a comma-separated list for each column. This is useful when there are multiple rows for the same `record_id` and event.
- **Group By**: The `GROUP BY id` ensures that the data is aggregated at the `record_id` level, producing one row per `record_id`.
- Other datasets such as MADRS, PHQ9, are similar in terms of query structure and output format

## Changelog

- **Version 1.0**: Initial query version to retrieve data for baseline and Week 10 events, with handling for duplicates using `GROUP_CONCAT()`.
